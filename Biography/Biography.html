                        <p><sup>1.</sup> My childhood was filled with adventure and curiosity. <sup>2.</sup> <i>My parents were hardworking, generous, and kind</i>. <sup>3.</sup> I was their only child, but I never felt lonely because I had many friends to play with. <sup>4.</sup> We used to live in a small apartment where many kids my age also lived. <sup>5.</sup> Every afternoon, we would gather outside <i>to play games like tag, hide and seek, and jump rope.</i> <sup>6.</sup> Our laughter echoed through the neighborhood as we ran around without a care in the world. <sup>7.</sup> My mother always reminded me to be kind to others, as she believed that kindness would always be repaid with kindness. <sup>8.</sup> <i>Her words stayed with me, and I carried them throughout my life.</i> <sup>9.</sup> <i>My favorite subjects were science and history</i> because I loved learning how the world worked and understanding the stories of people before me. <sup>10.</sup> I developed a passion for sports at a young age and started playing badminton when I was ten. <sup>11.</sup> Playing badminton taught me discipline and the value of hard work. <sup>12.</sup> Summers were the best time of the year because I would visit my grandparents in the province and enjoy farm life. <sup>13.</sup> I loved waking up early to watch the sunrise over the fields. <sup>14.</sup> I learned how to feed pigs, take care of chickens, and even plant vegetables. <sup>15.</sup> Despite my joyful childhood, I also faced challenges, especially during typhoon season. <sup>16.</sup> Our home was near a creek, so every time it rained heavily, the water level would rise, and we had to move our belongings to higher places to keep them dry. <sup>17.</sup> I remember nights when the power went out, and we had to light candles while waiting for the storm to pass. <sup>18.</sup> <i>These experiences taught me resilience and the importance of being prepared.</i> <sup>19.</sup> They also made me appreciate the simple joys in life. <sup>20.</sup> Looking back, I cherish the memories of those carefree days filled with laughter and excitement.</p>
